My name is Alizée Eupherte, after my licence at the Beaux-Arts Paris Malaquais architecture school I moved to Ecole Spéciale d'Architecture on Raspail Boulevard to continue my master.
Before that, I practiced global design for two years in Camondo in Paris. 

Here you will see some of my school projects, personal or professional projects.
